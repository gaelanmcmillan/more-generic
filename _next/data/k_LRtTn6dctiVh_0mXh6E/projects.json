Each complex sinusoid is plotted as a point in 2D space, with a short history of the previous frames points connected by lines.\nSpecific musical notes give way to recognizable patterns. Pretty fun to watch, if you ask me!\n"}},{"slug":"more-generic","frontmatter":{"title":"More Generic","author":"Gaelan McMillan","excerpt":"This very website!

Learned a lot, but now it's time to cull.\nFeatures I'd like to add are: sorting solutions by tag, automated upload of future solutions, and some actual blog posts!\n(Writing something worth reading is hard. Kudos to anyone who tries.)\n"}},{"slug":"boggle","frontmatter":{"title":"Boggle Solver","author":"Gaelan McMillan","excerpt":"An algorithmic solver for the board game Boggle.

The simplest way I saw to achieve this flipping illusion was by performing a point-to-point\nlinear interpolation between the positions of each neighbouring parallelogram.\nSo, in my second run, I first figured out how to calculate the points of each parallelogram\nbased on the appropriate translation and rotation in the pattern. I then used these parallogram\npoints to create parametrized animation functions so each flip can be performed smoothly in succession.\nEach animation function maps a value between zero and one to a point-to-point linear interpolation between two parallelogram geometries.\nThe flipping illusion is achieved by lerping the \"top\" and \"bottom\" points of the origin parallelogram\ntoward the \"bottom\" and \"top\" points of the destination parallelogram respectively...\n"}},{"slug":"wavey","frontmatter":{"title":"Discord Bot, \"Wavey\"","author":"Gaelan McMillan","excerpt":"A bot that uses Discord's message API and Google's text-to-speech API to play an interactive ear training game with server-goers.

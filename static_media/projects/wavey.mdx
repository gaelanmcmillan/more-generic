      A bot that uses Discord's message API and Google's text-to-speech API to play an interactive ear training game with server-goers. Made during RUHacks '22 
      The meat of the bot is just a simple "name that chord!" ear-training game. To make it, I recorded many many chords, labelled them, and transposed them through a few keys for some variety.
      It would be fun to revisit this concept and provide a more fully-featured ear-training experience!

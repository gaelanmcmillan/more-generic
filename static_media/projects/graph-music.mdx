      MIDI sequencer/sound generator based on ideas from automata theory and formal language. When you're tired of 808s and want your drum machine to be a labelled transition system.
      The web demo is fairly limited and buggy — it was only intended as a proof of concept. Currently working on a full VST3 plugin, using C++ and the JUCE framework!

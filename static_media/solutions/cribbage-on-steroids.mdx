*At the time of writing, this problem has a difficulty rating of 6.7 on Kattis, which qualifies as a Hard. It's fresh from the contest — I think the difficulty will even out to around a 4.0.*

This is a 3-part implementation task. Implement a cribbage scorer for `n`-length hands.

There are three main subtasks:
Given an array of integers...
1. ... **count all the ways you can sum to 15**.<br/>This is solveable in `n^2` steps using dynamic programming. See the function `count_sums_to_k` for implementation details.
2. ... **count all pairs of identical values**.<br/>This is given by `n` choose 2 (`n(n-1)/2`), with `n` being the frequency of each value in the array.
3. ... **count all ways to make a maximum length contiguous runs of length 3 or more** after sorting the array.<br/>This is done in linear time by iterating over an ordered map of the `{ value, frequency }`.

There are more implementation details to consider. For instance, Aces have a face value of 1, but 10s, Jacks, Queens and Kings all have a face value of 10.
Keeping all the requirements in order is key.

*No one task is difficult on its own, but implementing all three without writing a bug is the challenge! I overlooked the "length 3 or more" requirement for counting runs on my first try. Took a minute to catch.*
